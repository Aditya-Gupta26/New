I was assigned the task of maintaining the profile photo aspect of the app along with its requirements. In the project, the MainActivity5.java along with activity_main5.xml files contain the working code for this. The entire project is connected to Firebase. In the app, user is presewnted with their current profile picture. User may click on update photo button to open up a file chooser application on their device. From here, the user picks their new photo which is then displayed on the screen. On clicking update photo button, the profile picture of the user is updated. It works through the combination of Firebase storage and Firebase realtime database system. The updated photo is saved onto the Storage and a corresponding entry for the same is made in the Realtime database which helps in retrieving the image on app startup. Additionally, if the user wishes to remove their photo, they can do so by clicking on removing profile photo option. Now, the default profile picture gets displayed on the screen. 

Also, after completion of this task, I was assigned the task of maintaining the app usage time and limit. Hence, the user, on clicking Show time used button , can see the time spent on the activity. Additionally, there is a seperate activity by the name of MainActivity6.java, which along with activity_main6.xml code for a dedicated activity wherein user can see time spent on app, it works using a chronometer.
